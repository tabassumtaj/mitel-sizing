The database needs to be provided on a separate partition, and the size of the partition is determined by customer requirements, such as the number of calls, the number of users, and the database retention period. Calculators are available to determine the size of the database in advance. Since this is a database with high level of access, the use of SSD rather than HDD is recommended for the Medium and Large server configurations.Call and Screen Recording files are stored in Azure Cool Storage. 
This storage is expandable, depending on use and customer usage. Calculators are available to help determine the storage requirements in advance. This can be mapped directly for smaller systems. Access to the Cool Storage can be via the core server. However, where this storage exceeds 700G, it is recommended to use the Archive server as the front end to the Cool Storage, especially in a multi-server deployment.
